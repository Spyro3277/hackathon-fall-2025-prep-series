# Week 1 Lab - Teaser


**Goal:**  
Get comfortable calling real APIs. By the end, youâ€™ll be able to request live data from the CoinGecko API using your API key, inspect JSON responses, and practice with tools like Postman or curl.


## âœ… Prerequisites

- A GitHub account + your fork of this repo.
- Laptop with internet access.
- (Optional) VS Code installed if you prefer coding right away.


## ðŸ¥… Steps

### 1. Get Your API Key

1. Go to the [CoinGecko API docs](https://docs.coingecko.com/).
2. Sign up for a free/demo account.
3. Copy your **API key** â€” youâ€™ll need this for every request.
    - CoinGecko uses a header:
        ```
        x-cg-demo-api-key: CG-8XCzJxWFYG7NJNqG2FuebcXF
        ```

### 2. Sign in to Postman (VS Code) & Install the extension

1. Open VS Code.
2. Go to **Extensions Marketplace** â†’ search for **Postman** â†’ install.
3. **Sign up or log in** with your Postman account inside VS Code.
4. Create a **New HTTP Request**

### 3. Start with a simple request

#### 3A) In Postman (VS Code)

- Method: `GET`
- URL:
	```
	https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/ping
	```
- Headers:
```
x-cg-demo-api-key: YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

#### 3B) With cURL (terminal)

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/ping" \
  -H "x-cg-demo-api-key: YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```

You should see a tiny JSON response.

### 4. Add query params (markets endpoint)

Now call the **coins/markets** endpoint.

#### 4A) In Postman (VS Code)
- Method: `GET`
- URL (with query params inline):
